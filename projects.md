## Professional Work at SEEK

### 1. Career Hub Dashboard Optimization: Migration & Performance Improvement

**Challenge:** Career Hub Experiment tracking dashboard took several days to load and consumed excessive Databricks resources, impacting other users. Root cause: inefficient data structure with 21 separate SQL queries hitting generic shared tables in production.

**Solution:** Migrated to improved analytical structure → consolidated query set → rebuilt & validated Databricks dashboard (public details summarized due to confidentiality)

**Impact:**
- Reduced load time by **70%+** (days → 3-8 minutes)
- Decreased database CPU usage by ~60%
- Eliminated resource contention affecting other Databricks users
- Improved maintainability and created reusable analytical foundation

**Skills:** SQL optimization, data migration, CTEs, performance tuning, dimensional modeling, Databricks dashboards, technical documentation

### 3. User Segmentation Analysis
**Business Question:** "How many students and graduates who are unemployed viewed Microsoft-related content?"

**Approach:**
- Identified relevant data sources and tables
- Created analytical documentation defining metrics
- Wrote complex SQL with CTEs and CASE WHEN for segmentation
- Calculated engagement percentages across categories
- Documented methodology and findings in Confluence

**Skills:** SQL (CTEs, conditional logic), metric definition, documentation

### 4. Technical Documentation & Data Governance
**Deliverables:**
- Data flow diagrams showing relationships between data sources
- Dashboard documentation (metrics, terminologies, tracking logic)
- Technical documentation (query logic, migration steps, change logs)
- User guides and knowledge base articles

**Impact:** Improved team knowledge sharing, faster onboarding, reduced repetitive questions

**Tools:** Confluence, Excel, Miro, Markdown
