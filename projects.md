## Professional Work at SEEK

### 1. Dashboard Performance Optimization
**Challenge:** Analytics dashboard serving 100+ users had 45+ second load times due to 21 separate SQL queries hitting production database.

**Solution:** Analyzed query execution plans, identified redundant data fetches, and consolidated logic using CTEs and supporting tables.

**Impact:**
- Reduced load time by **70%+** (45s → 12s)
- Decreased database CPU usage by ~60%
- Improved maintainability (1 main query vs 21 separate queries)

**Skills:** SQL optimization, CTEs, performance tuning, Databricks, Tableau

---

### 2. End-to-End Dashboard Development
**Objective:** Build analytics dashboard for stakeholder decision-making from scratch.

**Process:**
- Gathered requirements from product and business teams
- Designed data models and calculated fields
- Built Tableau visualizations with custom calculations
- Created cohesive narrative flow for insights
- Deployed and validated with stakeholders

**Impact:** Enabled real-time KPI monitoring and data-driven decision making

**Skills:** Requirements gathering, data modeling, Tableau, stakeholder management

### 3. User Segmentation Analysis
**Business Question:** "How many students and graduates who are unemployed viewed Microsoft-related content?"

**Approach:**
- Identified relevant data sources and tables
- Created analytical documentation defining metrics
- Wrote complex SQL with CTEs and CASE WHEN for segmentation
- Calculated engagement percentages across categories
- Documented methodology and findings in Confluence

**Skills:** SQL (CTEs, conditional logic), metric definition, documentation

---

### 4. Technical Documentation & Data Governance
**Deliverables:**
- Data flow diagrams showing relationships between data sources
- Dashboard documentation (metrics, terminologies, tracking logic)
- Technical documentation (query logic, migration steps, change logs)
- User guides and knowledge base articles

**Impact:** Improved team knowledge sharing, faster onboarding, reduced repetitive questions

**Tools:** Confluence, Excel, Miro, Markdown
