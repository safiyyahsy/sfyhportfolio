subtitle: PowerBI Dashboard Design + Service Quality Insights (129,880 records)
---

## Project Overview
Built an interactive PowerBI dashboard to analyze airline passenger satisfaction and identify service areas most associated with dissatisfaction. The dashboard was designed as a multi-page report for quick KPI monitoring and drill-down analysis.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset
- **Size:** **129,880** passenger records
- **Key fields:** passenger demographics, travel class/type, service ratings (e.g., Wi-Fi, food/drink, seat comfort), overall satisfaction

## My Contribution
- Cleaned and validated the dataset (missing values / outliers) and prepared it for reporting
- Built a multi-page PowerBI report with consistent layout, navigation, and interactive filtering
- Created KPI views and segment breakdowns to support business-friendly interpretation

## Key Insights (from the dashboard)
- Highlighted service gaps linked to dissatisfaction (e.g., **in-flight Wi‑Fi**, **online booking ease**, **food/drink quality**)
- Identified segments with higher dissatisfaction rates by **class** and **customer type**
- Enabled quick filtering and drill-down for stakeholder self-service analysis

## Skills Demonstrated
- PowerBI (data modeling, interactive dashboards, report design)
- Data cleaning & validation (Excel / preprocessing)
- KPI design, segmentation analysis, data storytelling
